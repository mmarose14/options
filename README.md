# options
Python script for scanning and analyzing stock options chains

# Description
This is a Python script that grabs options chains data from an API (Tradier) for a list of symbols. 
It will then analyze the data and then write it to a file.

# Notes
1. Uses the Traider API (https://documentation.tradier.com/brokerage-api).
1. I used criteria specifically for my personal needs. This can be adjusted, as is the purpose of this script.
1. My criteria constantly changes, and the format of the output file constantly changes. Therefore, if one were to use this on their own, they would need to make their own adjustments.

Thanks for reading!
